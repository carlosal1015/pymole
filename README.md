## Overview

### Purpose and Scope

The **pymole** project is a Python library for implementing mimetic operators - discrete mathematical operators that preserve important geometric and physical properties when discretizing continuous differential operators. The library focuses on providing computationally efficient implementations of divergence, gradient, Laplacian, and interpolation operators for 1D, 2D, and 3D grids, with support for both uniform and non-uniform grid spacing.

### Project Architecture

The **pymole** library follows a hierarchical mathematical architecture where fundamental 1D operators serve as building blocks for higher-dimensional implementations. The project emphasizes scientific computing best practices with comprehensive testing, modern Python packaging, and automated quality assurance.

## Installation

The Python package `pymole` can be installed from GitHub:

```console
uv init
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/carlosal1015/pymole.git#egg=pymole
```

## Development installation

If you want to contribute to the development of `pymole`, we recommend
the following editable installation from this repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/carlosal1015/pymole
cd pymole
python -m pip install --editable .[tests]
```

Having done so, the test suite can be run using `pytest`:

```console
uv sync --extra=tests
uv run python -m pytest
```

```console
uv sync --extra=docs
uv run sphinx-build doc build
```

## PyPy Support

pymole fully supports PyPy for enhanced performance. To use with PyPy:

```console
pypy -m pip install git+https://github.com/carlosal1015/pymole.git#egg=pymole
```
